# The-Base-Control-Web-page
this is the second and third task of the smart method's summer internship 2021

in this task, we were asked to make a controlling interface for the base of the robot which included 5 movements (Forward, backward, left, right and stop)
Also a database to store the movement the user clicked.

You will notice that I combined the two interfaces in one webpage as requested.

As for the third task, we were asked to make a chatbot on our website through https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant?cm_sp=Scheduler-_-CopyChng2-_-C
and integrate it into our webpage. The bot is a little bit silly so don't mind me. I let the bot tell you about myself, Smart Methods, The project and why a summer internship is important. If you entered an odd word the bot will tell you it doesn't recognize it. You can also ask the bot about the date.

Thanks to the engineer Shaima Ahmed (Github: shaimadotcom ) for teaching me how to do it, she was patient with us and presented coherent steps.
