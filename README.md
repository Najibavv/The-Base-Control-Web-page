# The-Base-Control-Web-page
 this is the second task of the smart method's summmer internship 2021
 
 in this task we were asked to make a controling interface for the base of the robot which included 5 movements (Forward, backward, left, right and stop) 
 Also a databese to store the movement the user clicked.
 
 You will notice that I combained the two interfaces in one webpage as requsted.
